<h2>Before Making Changes</h2>
<p>Before making changes, advise the payment amount will change according to the new frequency.</p>
<h2>Switching to Semi-Monthly</h2>
<p>When switching frequency to semi-monthly, the customer will need to provide the exact 2 dates they get paid every month. You will need to change the first field that auto populates to one of the dates provided by the customer that is the closest to the first payment due date.</p>
<div class="note">
<strong>NOTE:</strong> Do not choose a date before the first due date.
    </div>
<h2>Date Change Guidelines</h2>
<ul>
<li>Do not change the date that auto populates on the first payment due date field for weekly, biweekly, or monthly frequency.</li>
<li>A due date change can be done after to make sure it aligns with the customer's payday as long as it does not skip a payment.</li>
<li>When changing frequencies, especially for monthly, be sure to advise of and collect any prorated amount from the customer.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Changing to Monthly</h2>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> When changing frequencies to monthly, we recommend customers not choosing the last day of the month. Instead, we would recommend using the first day of the month. This is due to potential issues caused by some months having a different total number of days. If the customer insists on it being the last day of the month, you must review each month in the “Due amounts” tab and manually adjust each of the following months to ensure the payment is on the last day of that month.</p>
