<h2>Auto-Pay Revoke Guidelines</h2>
<ul>
<li>If a customer is requesting to remove autopay, agents must follow the following guidelines:
            <ul>
<li>Make sure to ask all probing questions:</li>
<li>What is the reason of the request?</li>
<li>Can it be solved with a due date change, switching of payment methods, or payment arrangement?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Remind the customer the benefit of autopay.</li>
<li>If the customer is still insisting, read the script entirely and follow procedures to remove ACH/CC.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Auto-Pay Revoke Script</h2>
<p>
        On a recorded line, you are revoking consent to draft payments through autopay. By doing this, you understand that autopay was agreed to when signing the lease agreement and will now assume full responsibility to make payments to us.
    </p>
<p>
        Please be advised all payments need to be made on or before the due date. This can be done online or by calling us directly. If there are any late, missed, or returned payments, you understand this will void any eligibility for early payoff options.
