<h2>When you can offer a settlement</h2>
<p class="highlight">You can offer a settlement when:</p>
<ul>
<li>They are outside of their contract</li>
<li>Customer is seeking recovery (pick up) of items</li>
<li>Hardship</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="highlight">Guidelines</h3>
<ul>
<li>91-150 DPD: 50% of full remaining contract balance within 30 days</li>
<li>150+ DPD: 75% of full remaining contract balance within 30 days</li>
</ul>
<h2>Supervisor Approval</h2>
<p>Anything outside the guidelines needs to be approved by the Supervisor.</p>
<p>Confirm through documents if any settlement offers have been sent. If the last offer was sent several months ago, calculate the settlement offer based on the accountâ€™s DPD.</p>
<p>Once paid, a request to close the account must be made through the New System Channel in Teams.</p>
<div class="note">
<strong>Important:</strong> Settlements need to be scheduled once agreed upon. If any of the payments decline, the offer is voided.
