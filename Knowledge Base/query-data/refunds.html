<h2>Refunds</h2>
<p>A refund will be given if:</p>
<ul>
<li>Duplicate Payments or Customer overpaid due to UOwn's error</li>
<li>Payment was processed through the wrong payment method or wrong account.</li>
<li>Customer paid off/settled, but autopay continued to process</li>
<li>Customer had an active payment arrangement or is already in the MR process and a payment was processed.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Refund Process</h2>
<p>The agent can submit a refund request to their team lead who will be filling out an official refund request form and sending it to <a href="mailto:refunds@uownleasing.com">refunds@uownleasing.com</a>. All refunds must be reviewed and approved, and should not be guaranteed until this step is processed.</p>
<p>If the payment was processed through a checking or savings account within the past three (3) business days, the customer can submit a bank statement to expedite the process. Ask the customer to send a proof of payment clearing, with the beginning and ending balance, to <a href="mailto:docs@uownleasing.com">docs@uownleasing.com</a>.</p>
